### INTERACTIVE CUTAWAY RENDERING OF CORNER-POINT MODELS ###

The Oil&Gas industry uses numerical simulation to forecast production and
enhance the hydrocarbons recovery of oil fields. Since hydrocarbons reservoirs are
entities buried deep in the earthâ€™s crust, a simplified 3D geological model that mimics
this environment is generated to understand geological and physical concepts.order to run simulations this model is discretized in a 3D grid of hexahedral cells.addition, it is also used to present the results of simulations by assigning scalar values
to each cell. In this scenario, it is important to investigate the behavior of internal
cells that are often occluded by others. The Cutaway rendering method manages
the occlusion problem by selectively discarding portions of these overlapping objects
with less importance to, at the same time, expose the important features and keep
part of the secondary cells to support the visualization with contextual information.
This thesis introduces a GP U image based interactive method for cutaway rendering
of 3D reservoir models. Our technique is based on the depth value generatedthe fly by the proxy geometry of the cells in focus. We also present modificationsthe polygonal rendering pipeline to properly render the cutaway wall, as well as the
wireframe lines that are important to convey shape and amplify depth perception
